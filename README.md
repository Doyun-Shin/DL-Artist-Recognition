# DL-Artist-Recognition:
# Impressionist Artist Identifier through Convolutional Neural Network 
For our project, we aimed to develop a CNN multi-classification model of artists belonging to the same art movement, 
which entails a high degree of similarity among images. 
As such, we confined the scope of our model to famous impressionist painters. 
Our study design was based on the hypothesis addressed in previous researches that each artist possesses unique painting style, distinguishing oneself from another. 
The leading architecture used for image recognition is CNN. After exploring top-performing CNN architectures of The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 
(namely, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet), we decided to adopt Visual Geomatric Group (VGG) architecture inspired by VGG16 CNN model.
